Bot to manage the ACKS discord. 

This repo exists entirely so that I can work on this bot on either my laptop or desktop without sending a bunch of files back and forth. If you want to use it I allow you to under the MIT license or public domain, whichever is more permissive wherever you happen to live. That said, don't bother using this because it's not written for public consumption and is hacky and probably carcinogenic.
