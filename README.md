Bot to help ACKS GMs on the ACKS discord.

I've gotten some requests (precisely two of them) to share the bot code, so here it is in all its mediocre glory. The interesting scripts are all written by other people but the flimsy shell around them is all me. 

This bot relies on discord.py. 

The scripts folder is a python module so you may have to add that to your own modules path. It is a set of modulized versions of Golan's and jedavis's scripts. 

I haphazardly threw everything together, for now, because I have not been sufficiently badly burned by doing so. Someday I may clean this up. 

The GM tools cog does not work right now. I was toying with the idea of letting users start up their own play by post games via the bot, but it's very unfinished.

You should get your own bot key from the discord dev page and put it in the file "server_key" to run your own bot.
